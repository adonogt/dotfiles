# i3wm Configuration

A minimal i3 window manager setup focused on productivity and distraction-free workflow.

## Philosophy

In an age where our attention is constantly fragmented by screens and notifications, this configuration is built around the principle of intentional computing. Every element is designed to minimize distractions and maximize focus, allowing deep work without the noise of modern desktop environments.

Vim-style navigation keeps your hands on the keyboard. TUI tools replace graphical clutter. The Gruvbox color scheme provides warmth and reduces eye strain during extended sessions. This is a workspace that respects your time and attention.

## Disclaimer

This configuration reflects my personal workflow and specific needs. Please review the config file carefully and adapt only what serves your own requirements. What works for one person may not suit another. Use thoughtfully and modify freely.
